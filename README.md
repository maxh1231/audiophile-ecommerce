This is my submission for the 'Audiophile E-commerce' challenge provided by the popular site [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/audiophile-ecommerce-website-C8cuSd_wx). A design mockup, images, colors, and breakpoints are all provided, the goal is to emulate a given web design and functionality as closely as possible.

This is purely a frontend application with placeholder products intended to demonstrate my frontend skills.
